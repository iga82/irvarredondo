      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Bee game is an android application designed to target children and help get them to exercise. 
        The goal in the game, is to try and catch as many honey droplets that you can. There are settings 
        to change the difficulty and speed of the game. There are four difficulty modes. On "easy", the 
        bee only moves horizontally across the screen and can only be one color, yellow. On "normal", the 
        bee again only moves horizontally, but now honey droplets are different colors, so the player must 
        turn the bee different colors, by either rotating their bodies to face different directions or tapping 
        the bee (this is also a setting in the setting menu). In "hard" and "expert" modes, the bee is no longer
        constrained to moving horizontally across the screen but can now move freely in an direction. The 
        difference between the "hard" and "expert" modes is the speed. We try to accomplish getting the children 
        to exercise by making use of the compass in the android application, although this setting can be 
        disabled for people who have limited mobility or are feeling lazy.
