			Hello all! My name is Irving Arredondo, and I am a computer science major at the
			University of Texas at Austin. I was first drawn into computer science because I've
			always been a fan of puzzles, and I believe you can see every software problem as
			a huge puzzle, that you have to break into pieces, and then reassemble to get the 
			finished product.  I believe I have a natural ability to be able to solve puzzles,
			which I see as an asset in this field.  Technology is my passion, and I can't imagine
			doing anything else than working with it to create innovative products.
			Professionally, I see myself more interested in Software Development and Software Testing.
			I have a curiosity for learning new things burning inside of me, and can't wait to
			enter the professional field and grow as a computer scientist and as a person.<br><br>

			A few interests of mine are video games, music, and sports.  I am a die hard San Antonio Spurs 
			and Dallas Cowboys fan, even though the Cowboys have not had a successful season in quite some time.<br>
			I have a younger sister and a younger brother, who look up to me, so I always strive to be 
			the best that I can be, so I can set a good example for them.  I am a first generation American,
			both of my parents are from Mexico, and speak minimal English. I'm the first in my immediate 
			family to graduate high school, and did so as Valedictorian.  My sister is graduating this year
			and has also graduate as Valedictorian.  I was the first in my family to go to college, and I am
			proud to say that next year my sister will be joining me. Everything I do is for my family, 
			they're the most important thing in my life.  I'm a living example, that with hard work,
			anything can be accomplished, no matter what the odds are against you.
