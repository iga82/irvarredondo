My first attempt, as a solo project, of creating a website.
The purpose of this website is to showcase some of the past
projects I have done and give a little more information
about myself, than what is on my resume.

I am applying some of the knowledge that I have learned
from my past endeavours, such as using the Google Ape
Engine to host my website, which I learned from my
software engineering class.

I also started learning how to use new tools such as
Inkspace (free software, comparable to Adobe Illustrator)
and GIMP 2 (free software, comparable to Adobe Photoshop).

This is a work in progress and is constantly being updated
and imporved through the advice and opinion of others.
